\opening{Dear prospective user,}

Here is an implementation of the CU Boulder letterhead for \LaTeX.  This implementation is completely ``unofficial'' and may not match official university letterhead.  

The rest of this letter describes how to use the {\verb+boulder-ltr+} package.  

{\bf How do I use it?}
\begin{enumerate}

\item Use the ``letter'' document class.  You should declare your signature and other personal information in the preamble.  

\item Optionally decide on a logo.  The default is color, but you can use the {\verb+bw-logo+} option for the black-and-white logo.  There is an option ({\verb+no-logo+}) to remove the logo completely.  You may also use your own file.  To do so, you will need to redefine {\verb+\CULogo[BW]file+} in boulder-ltr.sty.

\item Need a different department? You will need to edit {\verb+\fulladdress+} and {\verb+\fulltelephone+} in boulder-ltr.sty.  

\item Optionally provide your signature as a pdf or jpeg file.

\end{enumerate}

{\bf Make it easier for me.}

Copy readme.tex to myletter.tex, modify as needed, and run pdflatex on it.

{\bf Options}

The {\verb+boulder-ltr+} package provides the following options.
\begin{itemize}
	\item {\verb+color-logo+} (default) Uses the CU Boulder color logo.
	\item {\verb+bw-logo+} Uses a black-and-white version of the CU Boulder logo.
	\item {\verb+no-logo+} Does not display any logo.
	\item {\verb+britdate+} Uses dd-mm-yyyy date format.
\end{itemize} 

{\bf Version history}

Version 0.1 is the initial version of {\verb+boulder-ltr+}.  Version 0.1 was made available on December 2, 2014.  

{\bf Comments, suggestions, and improvements}

The original distribution of boulder-ltr is at:\\
{\verb+http://math.colorado.edu/~seor3821/software/boulder-letterhead/+} 

Your comments, suggestions, and patches for the style file are especially welcome. 

%\closing{Sincerely,}

Good luck!
